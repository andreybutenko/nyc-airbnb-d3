## Assignment Description

For this assignment, you will be making a map of Airbnb locations in New York City. You will need these files for the assignment: data.csv, nygeo.json

You should plot each Airbnb location as a circle on the map of NYC.

Additionally, when the user clicks on a dot representing an Airbnb in NYC, transition it off of the SVG. [Use the rat map example as a guide](https://github.com/maptimeBoston/d3-maptime/tree/gh-pages/example6). You do not have to transition it to a random location of the screen, you may transition the circle in any direction as long as it disappears from the SVG. The opacity of the circle should be 0 at the end of the transition.

Upload your code to gh-pages and submit the link to your hosted website. Comment a link to your repo.
